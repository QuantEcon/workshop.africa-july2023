# Exercise Notebooks

See [syllabus](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10_wCC7VYoGAZ3dtts5uBvwCXr9GcyvdCd34nYPHY9V4/edit?usp=sharing) for a guide to exercise notebooks content

Notebooks should be added to

`exercises/{{ day-# }}` such as `exercises/day-1`

and we need both `exercise_set_1.ipynb` and `exercise_set_1_solutions.ipynb`
