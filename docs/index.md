# QuantEcon Summer Course in Quantitative Economics

The Summer Course in Quantitative Economics 2023 will be run by
[QuantEcon](https://quantecon.org/) in partnership with the [African School of
Economics](https://africanschoolofeconomics.com/) (ASE), and the [Institute of
Statistics and Applied Economics](https://ensea.ed.ci/) (ENSEA).  The target
audience for the course is talented young economists from ASE and ENSEA who
want to learn about  data science and computer-driven economic modeling.  

The course will provide students with an introduction and exposure to key
tools in quantitative economics that are in high demand in academic economics
and industry.

The workshop will run:
1. **Monday-Friday July 03-07**, and 
2. **Monday-Friday July 10-14**

The lead instructor and academic coordinator for the program is [Thomas J.
Sargent](http://www.tomsargent.com/), co-founder of QuantEcon, Professor of
Economics at New York University, and 2011 Nobel Laureate in Economic
Sciences.

## How will the Workshops Work? 

Due to the large number of enrolments, lectures will be pre-recorded rather
than live.  We will also provide exercises and a forum where you
can ask questions and get answers from instructors and your peers.  

New course videos will be released each day of the workshop

Students will require access to a computer.

## Syllabus

The language of instruction will be English.  

The programming language used in the course will be Python.

The course will cover selected topics from 

* Foundations of programming in Python
* Data engineering with Pandas
* Economic dynamics
* Linear algebra
* Optimization, filtering and dynamic programming 
* Search and matching models
* Asset pricing
* Bayesian and frequentist statistics
* Quantitative economic history
* High-performance computing with Python

Background reading on these topics can be found in the following lecture
series:

* [Python Programming for Economics and Finance](https://python-programming.quantecon.org/intro.html)
* [Quantitative Economics with Python](https://python.quantecon.org/intro.html)


## Mode of Instruction

Students will be provided with materials to help them prepare for classes and
solidify understandings of earlier classes.  

Students are encouraged to form study groups to foster working in teams (a
valuable skill in both industry and government and academia). We hope that
study groups can include students with mixtures of skills and mathematical and
statistics backgrounds. 


## Learning Outcomes

Participants will learn how to connect economic modeling problems to numerical
implementations in Python using clear, efficient and effective code.
Participants will be able to apply basic software engineering principles to
organize, share and collaborate on coding problems.

These skills are in high demand for economists and data scientists at leading
tech companies and universities around the world.

## Eligibility

The course material will be challenging.  Ideal candidates will already have
had at least some exposure to probability, linear algebra and principles of economics,
up to the level of a good undergraduate economics or computer science
program.  Programming experience will be helpful but is not a prerequisite.
