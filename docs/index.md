# QuantEcon Summer Course in Quantitative Economics 

The Summer Course in Quantitative Economics 2023 will be run by
[QuantEcon](https://quantecon.org/) in partnership with the [African School of
Economics](https://africanschoolofeconomics.com/) (ASE), and the [Institute of
Statistics and Applied Economics](https://ensea.ed.ci/) (ENSEA).  The target
audience for the course is talented young economists from ASE, ENSEA, and
other African institutions who want to learn about  data science and
computer-driven economic modeling.  

The course will provide students with an introduction and exposure to key
tools in quantitative economics that are in high demand in academia and
industry.

The workshop will run in 2023 over the weeks

1. **Monday-Friday July 03-07**
2. **Monday-Friday July 10-14**

Classes will be 3  hours per day, 5 days per week. 

The lead instructor and academic coordinator for the program is [Thomas J.
Sargent](http://www.tomsargent.com/), co-founder of QuantEcon, Professor of
Economics at New York University, and 2011 Nobel Laureate in Economic
Sciences.


## How will the workshops work? 

The  course will consist of a mixture of pre-recorded and (a small number of) live
lectures.  New course videos will be released each day of the workshop, along
with exercises.

Teaching assistants will run online live discussions and the organizers will
provide a forum for interaction with instructors and peers.  

All students will require access to a computer.

Students are encouraged to form study groups to foster working in teams (a
valuable skill in industry, government, and academia). 


## Syllabus

The language of instruction will be English.  

The programming language used in the course will be Python.

The course will cover selected topics about 

* Foundations of programming in Python
* Data engineering with Pandas
* Elementary economics with Python including 
    * geometric series and multiplier models 
    * demand and supply curves
    * competitive equilibria
    * monopoly 
    * models of economic growth
    * networks
    * elementary Markov chains
    * some elements of probability and statistics
* Economic dynamics
* Linear algebra
* Optimization, filtering and dynamic programming 
* Search and matching models
* Asset pricing
* Bayesian and frequentist statistics
* Quantitative economic history
* High-performance computing with Python

Background reading on these topics can be found in the lecture
series [Python Programming for Economics and Finance](https://python-programming.quantecon.org/intro.html) and in a soon to be released lecture series about elementary economics, at the quantecon site.



## Learning outcomes

Participants will learn how to connect economic modeling problems to numerical implementations in Python using clear, efficient and effective code.
Participants will be able to apply basic software engineering principles to organize, share and collaborate on coding problems.

These skills are in high demand for economists and data scientists at leading tech companies and universities around the world.

## Eligibility

We shall strive to make classes assessible to students who want to learn Python and how to use it in economics.  That said, the course material will be challenging.  Ideal candidates will already have had at least some exposure to probability, linear algebra and principles of economics, including part of an undergraduate degree in economics or computer science.  

Programming experience will be helpful but is not a prerequisite.

## Contact

Organizers of the program can be reached through `contact@quantecon.org`.

## Registration Details

Very soon there will be instructions at the quantecon website about how to register for the class.
